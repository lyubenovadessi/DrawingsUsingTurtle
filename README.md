# 🎨 Turtle Drawings with Random Colors (OOP)
A collection of Python turtle graphics projects that use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to generate colorful geometric patterns — including polygons and spirographs — using a custom RgbColors class.

# 🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python’s built-in turtle graphics module together with random color generation via a custom OOP class (RgbColors).
You can visualize creative geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, pentagons, and even stunning spirograph designs — all dynamically colored with random RGB values.

# 💡 How It Works
1. RgbColors Class - This class encapsulates the logic for generating random RGB colors.
2. shapes.py - Draws a series of regular polygons, starting from a triangle (3 sides) up to a decagon (10 sides), each in a random color. Result: You’ll see a sequence of geometric shapes drawn in random colors, layered beautifully on the screen
3. spirograph.py - Generates a colorful spirograph — a mesmerizing circular pattern drawn by rotating small circles around a center. Result: A vibrant, rotating spirograph that continuously changes color.

# 🧩 Features
  1. Uses Object-Oriented Programming for reusable color generation.
  2. Fully interactive with Python’s turtle module.
  3. Creates both polygonal shapes and spirograph patterns.
  4. Beautiful color randomization using RGB mode (colormode(255)).
  5. Simple structure and beginner-friendly.

# ⚙️ Requirements
  - Python 3.7+
  - No external libraries required (only built-in turtle and random).

# 🚀 How to Run
  1. Clone or download the project files.
  2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
  3. Run one of the drawing scripts:
    - python shapes.py
    - python spirograph.py
  4. Watch the turtle create random colorful art! 🎨
  5. Click anywhere on the screen to close the window.

# 💡 Tips & Customization
  1. Change SIZE or CIRCLES_COUNT in spirograph.py to create denser or looser patterns.
  2. Adjust the range in for shape_side_n in range(3, 11) to add more shapes.
  3. Try experimenting with dess.speed() for faster or slower drawing.
